            <h2>Hey! I'm Holly</h2>
            <h3>I am a web Developer who is currently based in the Atlanta Area. I have always been interested in design, but recently discovered full stack development and havenâ€™t been able to stop since. I am currently in the Front End We Development bootcamp at Thinkful and set to graduate in September. My interests include design, reading, coffee, hiking, and catching up with friends. Feel free to reach out or browse some of my projects below!</h3>
